The animals seemed desperately unhappy because of the rain, and were all growling gloomily. When she awoke, both the growling and the rain went on just the same. The growling was the heavy regular breathing of her sister Jane, who had a slight cold and was still asleep. The rain fell in slow drops on to Anthea\u2019s face from the wet corner of a bath-towel out of which her brother Robert was gently squeezing the water, to wake her up, as he now explained.\n\n\u201cOh, drop it!\u201d she said rather crossly; so he did, for he was not a brutal brother, though very ingenious in apple-pie beds, booby-traps, original methods of waking sleeping relatives, and the other little accomplishments which make home happy.\n\n\u201cI had such a funny dream,\u201d Anthea began.\n\n\u201cSo did I,\u201d said Jane, waking suddenly and without warning. \u201cI dreamed we found a Sand-fairy in the gravel-pits, and it said it was a nymph, and we might have a new wish every day, and\u201d\u2014\n\n\u201cBut that\u2019s what I dreamed,\u201d said Robert; \u201cI was just going to tell you,\u2014and we had the first wish directly it said so.

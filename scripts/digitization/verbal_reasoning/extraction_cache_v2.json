        "title": "Anne Frank",
        "content": "Anne Frank was born in 1929 in Germany. When the Nazis took power in 1933 and began to persecute the Jews, the Frank family fled to Amsterdam. In 1940 the Germans invaded the Netherlands, and on 5th July 1942 Anne\u2019s sister, Margot, was commanded to report to a Nazi work camp. The family went into hiding the next day in concealed rooms at the back of their father Otto\u2019s workplace. The entrance to the \u2018Secret Annexe\u2019 was hidden behind a bookcase in Otto\u2019s former office, which was still in use. During the day, the family had to remain silent to prevent detection.\n\nTo pass the time, Anne wrote secretly in a diary she had received on her thirteenth birthday. She addressed her daily entries to Kitty, her imaginary friend. The first entry read, \u201cI hope I will be able to confide everything to you and you will be a great source of comfort and support.\u201d The family spent two years in hiding, never going outside, receiving provisions from trusted friends. This was demanding and Anne wrote on 3rd February 1944, \u201cI\u2019ve reached the point where I hardly care whether I live or die.\u201d\n\nThey were given away by an anonymous betrayer and on 4th August 1944 the Nazis stormed the apartment. Anne and her sister were transported to Auschwitz concentration camp in Poland where they were made to haul heavy stones. Eventually they were moved to Bergen-Belsen concentration camp in Germany, where food was scarce and they contracted typhus. Both sisters died a few weeks before the British soldiers liberated the camp in March 1945. Otto, the family\u2019s only surviving member, published her diary in 1952.\n\nAnne was just one of over a million Jewish children who died during the Holocaust.",
